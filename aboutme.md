---

[ManageIQ](http://manageiq.org) is the management platform use to manage hybrid cloud. It is possible to automate environment using [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com) after ManageIQ Fine release.

Our task is to develope Ansible playbook which can be imported in ManageIQ and achieve automation.

Further We need to enhance that code for automate.

This is really exciting project for me.
